  Attack x plugins will use 30 minute skips except khan which will use one hour skips.
  Beri cooldown is bypassed.
  The incoming messages will come with a preview of the attack.
  Replace Mead Storm will only replace mead if it sees there is 2.1 hours left and wont skip bewarned.
  Khan does NOT replace your defence at the current becareful when running for too long.
